AshGraphQL is a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) extension for the [Ash framework](https://ash-hq.org/). It gives you an efficient way to expose your application resources over a GraphQL API. You configure what you want to expose and AshGraphQL will generate an [Absinthe](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe) schema which will resolve data straight from your Ash resources.

See the [getting started guide](https://ash-hq.org/docs/guides/ash_graphql/latest/tutorials/getting-started-with-graphql.md) for information on setting it up, and see the `AshGraphql.Resource` documentation for docs on its DSL. See the [hexdocs](https://ash-hq.org/docs/dsl/ash_graphql/latest/ashgraphql-resource) for more information.
